# PyTorch Conv2d

PyTorch is the most popular library among researchers as it provides more control over algorithm. As you have to provide each parameter manually it can slow you down.

For example: torch.nn.Conv2d() API. Here, we have to provide padding, kernel size etc. We have to calculate these parameters to get the desired output shape and gain more control.

**Here, I am trying to solve exactly this problem.**
